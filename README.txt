Chess_PyGame

When I was in high school, I made chess in the not so used programming
language, visual basic. The game relied on console input, the
board itself was made of text characters and there were still some bugs
when a player was in a check/checkmate. Although I was pretty happy
about it at the time. With the knowledge I've gained from the first
semester of uni and some self studying, I knew I could do better, so
here is my second attempt at chess. Maybe some time in the future I'll
try again and make 3D chess ;)
